# BMEN509-FinalProject (Winter 2022)
Python script that takes a DICOM file of a CT scan as input and outputs a PLY file that can be converted to an STL file and 3D printed.

This project was completed for BMEN509 - Introduction to Biomedical Imaging. The goal of this project was to create a script that took CT scan data in the form of DICOM files and create 3D printible mesh in the form of an STL file. Due to time contraints the output file was written as a PLY instead of an STL which was then converted to an STL in Blender while cleaning the mesh.
